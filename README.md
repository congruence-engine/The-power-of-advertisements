# The power of advertisements

##  Depictions of domestic appliances in magazines and the parallel emergence of gas and electricity as sources of energy

## Short summary
The investigation aims at examining the application of computer vision tools to photos of documents and objects within historical collections. It takes as its case study the identification of domestic appliances in advertisements found within journals and magazines. To achieve this, the investigation is working in collaboration with the archives of the Institute of Engineering & Technology, which entity provided the Congruence Engine project with the digitised volume of The Electrical Age. It is also planned to assess how texts within and surrounding the advertisements can improve the identification of objects on images.
